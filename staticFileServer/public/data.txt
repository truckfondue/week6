Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. Well excuse me for liking the way they frame my junk! Pound is tic-tac-toe right? Chickens don't clap! 

He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. I see you've wasted no time in filling my seat hole. You need to do more with Rita. Believe me, I'd like to. She calls it a mayonegg. Why are you squeezing me with your body? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Oh, yeah, the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in 3 months. Come on! 

You can control your bladder when you're dead! That was Tom Cruise, the actor. Lucille: They said he was some kind of scientist. She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen. What's next, Michael? Are you going to make dancing illegal? Is this the tiny town from Footloose? I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man. Perhaps an attic shall I seek. 

Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than anywhere in the OC? Michael, look, this has got to stop. I mean, flattered? Yes. Interested? Not tonight. No borders, no limits… go ahead, touch the Cornballer… you know best? One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! Hahahaha. How am I supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap? Daddy horny, Michael. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? 

I'm a complete failure. I can't even fake the death of a stripper. I just haven't had sex in a month. You know, you've been here two months. It's hard to gauge time. I may have committed some light treason. Don't ask "Can I"… ask "I Can!" Yes. Lindsay and I are planning a night of heterosexual intercourse. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. Michael: It's just Mom and whores. I'll have a vodka rocks. (Mom, it's breakfast time.) And a piece of toast. 

I don't want no part of yo' tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! Got a big ass room at the travelodge.  What a fun, sexy time for you. 

I've made a huge tiny mistake. You might enjoy this.  Oh. Em. Gee. That's amazing. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? 

Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. Tobias is Queen Mary. 

Shémale. Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape-horn? Oh…yeah…the guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette. You mean the guy we're meeting with can't even grow his own hair? Come on! NO TOUCHING! Talk you off what, Pop Pop? 

What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? I call it Tricks –- wait for it – Around The Office.
